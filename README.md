# 2D_and_time_constant_fit_demo
 A demonstration of 2D fitting of a phenomenological model on an scattering image.

## Structure of raw data contained in Raw_data directory
The Raw_data directory contains data from one scan measured at 13.4 mJ/cm^2 laser pump fluence and 1 mJ/cm^2 EUV (Ni M3 edge) fluence. The directory contains four subfolders labeled as followes:-
1. WX15_Y16_Scan041/rawdata:- contains the raw detector images from the scan.
2. WX15_Y16_Scan041_BG/rawdata:-
3. WX15_Y16_Scan041_OF/rawdata:-
4. WX15_Y16_Scan041_OL/rawdata:-

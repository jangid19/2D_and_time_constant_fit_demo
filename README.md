# 2D_and_time_constant_fit_demo
 A demonstration of 2D fitting of a phenomenological model on small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) from coexisting labyrinthine and stripe domain morphologies for publication uploaded to arXiv at this DOI:https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2303.16131.

## Structure of raw data contained in Raw_data directory
The Raw_data directory contains data from one scan measured at pump fluence of 13.4 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> and 1 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> EUV (Ni M<sub>3</sub> edge) fluence. The directory contains four subfolders labeled as follows:-
1. WX15_Y16_Scan041/rawdata:- contains the raw detector images from the scan.
2. WX15_Y16_Scan041_BG/rawdata:- contains detector background images.
3. WX15_Y16_Scan041_OF/rawdata:- contains detector images with just X-rays on the samples.
4. WX15_Y16_Scan041_OL/rawdata:- contains detector images with just the pump laser on the samples.
